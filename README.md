Homework 4

This project utilizes elements of javascript and jQuery to create a functional randomly-generated numbers game. 

The functionality of this game is useful for create a baseline setup of similar games and introduces people to basic javascript and jQuery functions.

Users can get started with the project by first understanding how javascript works and the different elements included in the jQuery database.

Use Google and research what javascript does, the syntax that javascript uses, and look up what jQuery is and how it is used alongside javascript to create a functional game like this one.
